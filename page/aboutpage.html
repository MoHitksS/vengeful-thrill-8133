    <div id="dontcry">
      Fitness Blender was created by just two people; a husband and wife team
      of personal trainers who thought fitness should be accessible to
      everyone, regardless of their income. Both Kelli and Daniel felt like
      there was a lack of reliable health and fitness information on the web,
      and too many people in the industry were more focused on monetary gain
      or appearance than they were on good health.
