The project is built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The aim is to learn basic technologies in web development along with some advanced concepts like Async-Await and Promises. The project also includes fetching data from a local API which mimics an actual API. 

The clone has some dynamic as well as some static pages. All the pages are made to look like exact replicas of the original pages. Flex is used to build responsive design of the pages. Also the functionality of the pages are made to replicate the original.

## Some of the important functionalities:

The Calender Scheduling feature of the website is one of the most important features. The calender is made using grid and the logic is done using javascript. The scheduling is done using local storage. Apart from scheduling a video in the calender, the feature also has deleting function where the schedule gets deleted. Following is the working of the same.

The website also has Add to Cart functionality in the workout programs page. The data in workout programs page is fetched from a local mock API. Also the data can be sorted according to Price, Name, Length of the program. The programs can also be filtered using keywords search. The add to cart functionality is done using local storage. The shopping cart is populated with the products that you add to cart. On proceeding to checkout, it takes us to checkout page wherein you can place the order, which then takes you directly to the My Programs page and the bag becomes empty.
